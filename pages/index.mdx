# HappyPath

## Introduction

HappyPath gives developers a simple way to create and manage remote configuration files to control any part of your application from the cloud.

### What are Remote Config files?

Remote Configuration files (aka dynamic configs) are key/value pairs that give you flexibility over your application, giving you the control over any aspect of your software application without the need to deploy your code. You can simply make a change to the configuration file, and the application will change immediately.

### What can you do with Dynamic Config files?

There 3 key benefits of using remote config files:

- Modify your app without a new production deployment
- Roll out features gradually and monitor the impact
- Customize content for different audiences
